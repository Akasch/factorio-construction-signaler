Version: 0.16.1
Date: 2018-09-17

* Fix compatibility with the Robocharger mod (and any other mods that add zero-radius Roboports).
* Performance improvements:
  * Cache the list of signals for each signaler, and don't tell the Factorio engine to update the signals except when they've changed.
  * Use a lookup table for the deduping logic, to speed things up where there are lots of ghosts.
